# The best of the best AI knowledge repositories
From my own experience, I will tell you that GitHub repositories collecting information about AI are like surprise cookies. Sometimes we will find a delicious apple pie, and sometimes we will get a zbuk. There is nothing to be discouraged, because in my opinion they are really valuable resources that can support our journey in machine learning. Often, several dozen (or even several hundred) people work on one repository and update it!

To help you, I've shared a list of curated repositories on GitHub for machine learning and artificial intelligence in one place. For convenience, I divided them into several categories.

PS. If you liked it, please give a ⭐ to this repo!
